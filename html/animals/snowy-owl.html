        Aurora is our beautiful snowy owl, named after the northern lights that dance across her arctic homeland. These magnificent birds are known for their pristine white plumage and piercing yellow eyes.

Snowy owls are incredible hunters with exceptional hearing and nearly silent flight. Aurora can rotate her head 270 degrees and has asymmetrical ear openings that help her pinpoint prey even under snow.

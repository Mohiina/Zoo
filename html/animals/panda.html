      <p>Bamboo is our gentle giant panda, one of the world's most beloved and endangered species. These magnificent bears are known for their distinctive black and white coloring and peaceful nature.

        Giant pandas spend most of their day eating bamboo - up to 14 hours! Despite being classified as carnivores, 99% of their diet consists of bamboo. Bamboo loves to climb and often can be found resting in tree branches.</p>
